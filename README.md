# Ashraf Mohammad — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, created to showcase my experience, technical skills, and selected data engineering projects in a clean and minimal format.

## Live Website

https://iashrafmd.github.io/portfolio/

## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to:

- Present my background as a Data Engineer  
- Highlight selected projects with measurable business impact  
- Demonstrate clean and maintainable frontend architecture  
- Provide a fast, lightweight, and accessible user experience  

The design approach is inspired by Apple-style minimalism — simple, focused, and content-driven.

## Architecture Overview

This is a fully static, data-driven website.

index.html  
main.js  
projects.json  

Project data is stored separately in JSON and rendered dynamically using JavaScript, keeping content independent from presentation.

This approach allows easy updates without modifying HTML structure.
